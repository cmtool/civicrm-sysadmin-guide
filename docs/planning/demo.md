# Test it out

## Free Demonstration sites

CiviCRM hosts several demo sites - there is at least one for each of the
supported **Content Management Systems** (CMS) - Drupal, Joomla, and
WordPress. The demo sites present a working copy of the latest stable
version of CiviCRM with sample data. You can use them to play around
with CiviCRM, but be aware that they are publicly viewable so you
shouldn't enter personal data.

A list of the available demos can be found at
[https://civicrm.org/demo](https://civicrm.org/demo).

The demo sites may be configured strangely, missing functionality or
appear in different languages, as other people may be experimenting with
them at the same time as you.

The demos have some limitations - you can't send emails from them, you
can't set permissions for Drupal users or do a full exploration of
online payment options.

If you are having trouble working on a demo site, contact the CiviCRM
[Core Team](https://civicrm.org/teams/core-team). If you want a more controlled
environment for exploring CiviCRM, install your own test site or try CiviCRM Spark.

## Using CiviCRM Spark as a private demonstration site

[CiviCRM Spark](https://civicrm.org/spark) can be used as a half-way step between 
the free public demonstration sites and setting up a private full CiviCRM installation. 
With [CiviCRM Spark](https://civicrm.org/spark) you can get CiviCRM up-and-running in 
minutes on SAS hosting. CiviCRM Spark starts from $9.50 a month, and you can cancel at 
any time. This method can be a quick way for testing and trialing CiviCRM, or for on-going
use by smaller organizations and activities with up to 2,000 contacts.

## Test installations

You can [download and set up a local version of CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/download), that is a
version that is stored on your local computer rather than on a server on
the Internet. You'll still access it through a browser, but it will only
be visible on your computer. The advantage of a test installation is
that you can configure CiviCRM, and experiment with your data.
